Hello GitHub world!

My name's Simon and I have no coding experience whatsoever. Well, that's a small lie, I began coding with Python at the end of 2017 but apart from that I have no coding experience, honest! 

As of writing this, I am a senior development scientist working in a micro/molecular biology field. I wanted to teach myself a coding language mainly for fun/interest. However, I've been able to apply the basics of python to automate simple tasks with my data analysis at work and am quickly falling down the rabbit hole and realising the potential of Python. What I hope to do is share some of the code I have written and learn from the experts out there. I am sure the scripts I have written at the moment will not be the most efficient, but that's why I'm here.

I did try Java for a while before Python, but because of my field of work, Python has stuck.

pymonghetti out!
